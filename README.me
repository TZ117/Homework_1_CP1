Assignment: Rename the x and y variables h and s (for "hue" and "saturation"). In your README.me file, answer: what changes in the animation when you renamed the variables? What if you change them to nonsense names, like "dog" and "cat"?
Answer: The animation changes from colorful to blank white background. Because dog or cat is not a location specific variable.
